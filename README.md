# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Banking Transactions

This project focuses on developing robust fraud detection models for e-commerce and banking transactions at Adey Innovations Inc.  By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition, we aim to significantly improve fraud detection accuracy and enhance transaction security.  This document details the model deployment and API development process.

## Overview

Fraud detection is crucial for maintaining trust and preventing financial losses in the financial technology sector. This project addresses the need for accurate and adaptable fraud detection models capable of handling the unique characteristics of both e-commerce and bank credit transaction data.  Effective fraud detection systems empower businesses to identify and respond to fraudulent activities in real-time, minimizing risks and protecting customers.

## Business Need

Adey Innovations Inc. requires a robust fraud detection solution to minimize financial losses and build customer trust.  This project aims to develop, deploy, and serve such a solution via an API, enabling seamless integration with existing systems.

## Project Goals

* Analyze and preprocess transaction data from various sources.
* Engineer relevant features to enhance fraud pattern identification.
* Develop and train machine learning models for fraud detection.
* Evaluate and optimize model performance.
* Deploy models for real-time fraud detection via a Flask API.
* Dockerize the application for easy deployment.
* Implement logging for continuous monitoring.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing

(Same as before - see previous response)

### Task 2: Model Building and Training

(Same as before - see previous response)

### Task 3: Model Deployment and API Development

* **Setting Up the Flask API**:
    * **Create the Flask Application**:
        * Create a new directory for your project (e.g., `fraud-detection-api`).
        * Create a Python script `serve_model.py` to serve the model using Flask.  This script will load the trained model and define the API endpoints.
        * Create a `requirements.txt` file to list dependencies (Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.).
    * **API Development**:
        * Define API endpoints (e.g., `/predict`).  The API endpoint should accept transaction data as input and return a fraud prediction (e.g., 0 or 1, along with a probability score).
        * Test the API using tools like `curl` or Postman.
    * **Dockerizing the Flask Application**:
        * Create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Run serve_model.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "serve_model.py"]
